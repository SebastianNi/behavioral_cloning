# Project: Behavioral Cloning
## My 3rd Project in the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Link to the Udacity project repository

https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3

### Project Overview
In this project, I used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I trained, validated and tested a model using Keras. The model output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

### Output video

The project generates a video of a car driving all by itself using [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). The output video can be watched [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0agIiDyIPj1WXVGZDJLdTlmY00/view?usp=sharing).

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)

### Run

This is not a stand-alone project. In order to run the code, please follow the instructions on the [Udacity project repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3). You will need [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) as well as the files [**drive.py**](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3/blob/master/drive.py) and [**video.py**](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3/blob/master/video.py) from the [Udacity project repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3).
